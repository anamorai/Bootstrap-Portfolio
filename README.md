# Bootcamp Portfolio

I have been tasked with building a portfolio of my recent work including a profile and contact information - using bootstrap. This portfolio will be the perfect way to showcase my ability in a fun and interactive way.  

To complete this I will
*  Create a website that will include the following bootstrap components:
    - My name, featured in the logo in the top left of the page.
    - A Navigation bar that has links that are applicable to my portfolio and in working order.
    - A jumbotron which features a picture and an important slogan and quote. 
    - A work section which displays my work in grid. For the purpose of this project I will be using websites I like as placeholders and will not be taking actual credit for these websites.
    - Bootstrap cards for each project with a brief description and a working link to each website.
    - A skills section that lists the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp, and some I already possess, within a drop down menu that explains a little about each one.
    - An about / contact section.
    - A footer section with interactive buttons.
    - All hyperlinks have a hover effect.
    - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

## Installation

The website is also mobile-friendly and will look like this on a phone:
